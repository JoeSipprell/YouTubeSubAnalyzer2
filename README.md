# YouTubeSubAnalyzer2
Provides data on all of the channels you are subscribed to on youtube

This project uses the YouTube Data, JavaFX, and JSoup APIs.

Instructions: Copy the URL of your YouTube channel and paste it into the text box, then click go 
 
Warnings: 
1. The channels you subscribe to are set to private by default, so you will have to change that setting on YouTube

TODO:
1. Make YouTube channel URL input work - DONE
2. Insert a 'more data' page
3. Create JavaDoc documentation for this
4. Multithreading so loading messages are displayed
5. Make it look better, possibly YouTube themed
6. Possibility of YouTube channels that aren't tracked by socialblade - DONE
7. Use OAuth so that the user doesn't have to set their subscriptions to public
8. Make a restart button that clears everything out and lets you put in another channel
9. Add options to insert another youtube channel into the table and to delete a channel fromthe table
10. Add a 'help' button for this that displays a pop-up message with instructions
11. Possibly make an android app that does this?
